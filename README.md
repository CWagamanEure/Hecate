# Hecate: EVM Crossing Batch Auction Network 


## What is a Crossing Network?

A Crossing Network is not a bridge to another blockchain. Rather, its a term coined in Centralized Finance. A Crossing Network is an alternative
exchange which derives its price from the continuous order flow of another exchange. As you may have guessed, these types of exchanges have been in 
the past very controversial, in that many people believe they are unfairly feeding off the hard work of someone elses orderflow. Most of the time, these exchanges
are used to hide orderflow from a standard exchange, used if a trader would rather sacrifice speed for discreteness.

## Research Project Goals:
- Create an alternative EVM dex, which sacrifices speed for more discrete orders and potentially better prices
- Commit and Reveal structure which avoids storing orders on-chain until trade execution 
- Bond collected to discourage order griefing
- Link pricing to oracle midPrice
- Create the "Darks Pools" for the EVM

### BondVault

### OrderStore

### OrderMatchingEngine
